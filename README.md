## Bug Bounty ðŸ’°

### Rewards

Severity of bugs will be assessed under the [CVSS Risk Rating](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0) scale, as follows:

 - Critical (9.0-10.0): Up to $100,000
 - High (7.0-8.9): Up to $10,000
 - Medium (4.0-6.9): Up to $5,000
 - Low (0.1-3.9): Up to $1,000

In addition to assessing severity, rewards will be considered based on the impact of the discovered vulnerability as well as the level of difficulty in discovering such vulnerability.

### Disclosure

Any vulnerability or bug discovered must be reported only to the following email: contact@dodoex.io; must not be disclosed publicly; must not be disclosed to any other person, entity or email address prior to disclosure to the contact@dodoex.io email; and must not be disclosed in any way other than to the contact@dodoex.io email. In addition, disclosure to contact@dodoex.io must be made promptly following discovery of the vulnerability. Please include as much information about the vulnerability as possible, including:

 - The conditions on which reproducing the bug is contingent.
 - The steps needed to reproduce the bug or, preferably, a proof of concept.
 - The potential implications of the vulnerability being abused.
 
A detailed report of a vulnerability increases the likelihood of a reward and may increase the reward amount.

Anyone who reports a unique, previously-unreported vulnerability that results in a change to the code or a configuration change and who keeps such vulnerability confidential until it has been resolved by our engineers will be recognized publicly for their contribution, if agreed.
